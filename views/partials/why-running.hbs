          <h2>Why I'm Running!</h2>
          <p>My name is Derrick Jackson and I’m running to be the next Sheriff of Washtenaw County. For the past 14 years, I’ve had the honor of serving as the Director of Community Engagement for the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office, where I’m responsible for engaging all facets of our community and working to build a more just, more diverse, and more trusted sheriff’s office. </p><br>
          <p>Having worked alongside criminal justice reformers like Sheriff Clayton for over a decade, I am excited by the opportunity we have at this moment to push this work forward. Our goals of making our community more just, our policing practices more focused on community policing, rehabilitation, and community-based solutions is possible. We’ve come a long way, but there is still much to be done. With Sheriff Clayton’s full support, I am the candidate with the experience to make these dreams reality, and I hope you will join me on this journey.</p><br>
          <p>Our campaign will be bold - we have new ideas to make our community more accepting, safer, and that bring us together, not perpetuate division. It will be big - we will work to engage with residents from Manchester to Ypsilanti, and everywhere in between. And it will certainly be better with your help. That is why I am asking you to join me, and help continue to build a sheriff’s office that works for all Washtenaw County residents by voting Derrick Jackson for Sheriff in the Democratic Primary in August, 2024.</p>
